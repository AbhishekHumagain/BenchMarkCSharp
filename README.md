# CPUIntensivePOC

## Overview

`CPUIntensivePOC` is a .NET project that demonstrates the use of an in-memory data processor with a focus on performance testing. The project includes a class named `InMemoryDataProcessor` that uses `MemoryCache` and `Dictionary` to handle large objects efficiently. Performance is assessed using BenchmarkDotNet and stress testing.

## Project Structure

- **`InMemoryDataProcessor.cs`**: Contains the `InMemoryDataProcessor` class with methods for adding/updating and retrieving data.
- **`BenchmarkDotNet`**: Contains benchmarking code to measure the performance of `AddOrUpdateData` and `GetData` methods.
- **`StressTest.cs`**: Contains code for stress testing the `InMemoryDataProcessor` under high load conditions.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 8.0 or later recommended)
- [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbhishekHumagain/BenchMarkCSharp.git
   cd CPUIntensivePOC
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

## Running the Code

### 1. **Run Benchmarks**

To run the performance benchmarks:

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.
2. Build and run the benchmarking project:

   ```bash
   dotnet run -c Release
   ```

   This will execute the benchmarks defined in the `InMemoryDataProcessorBenchmark` class and generate a detailed report.

## Checking Benchmark Results

After running the benchmark:

1. **Review Benchmark Results**: The results will be output to the console or terminal where you ran the `dotnet run` command. BenchmarkDotNet provides detailed metrics including:
   - Mean execution time
   - Memory allocations
   - Garbage collection statistics

2. **Analyze Results**: Use the output data to analyze the performance of different methods in your `InMemoryDataProcessor` class. BenchmarkDotNet will generate a report with performance metrics, which you can use to identify areas for optimization.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Errors**: If you encounter issues with the project file or build errors, ensure all dependencies are up to date and the .NET SDK is correctly installed.
- **Parsing Errors**: If there are issues parsing project files, check for special characters or malformed XML in your `.csproj` files.
